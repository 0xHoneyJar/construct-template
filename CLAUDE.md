# My Construct

> Status: draft — customize after creating from template

## Who I Am

A [describe archetype] for the Loa ecosystem. I specialize in [primary domain] with a [disposition] approach to problem-solving.

See `identity/persona.yaml` for full cognitive frame and voice definition.

## What I Know

| Domain | Depth | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Primary Domain | 4/5 | Core capability area, secondary capability area |

See `identity/expertise.yaml` for full domain definitions and hard boundaries.

## Available Skills

| Command | Skill | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/example-command` | `example-skill` | TODO: describe what this skill does |

## Workflow

1. User invokes a command
2. Construct applies domain expertise and cognitive frame
3. Skill executes its defined workflow
4. Output is produced within declared boundaries

## Hard Boundaries

What this construct will **not** do:

- TODO: Define explicit refusals
- TODO: Define when to defer to a different construct
- TODO: Define safety constraints

These boundaries are enforced by `identity/expertise.yaml` and each skill's `SKILL.md`.
